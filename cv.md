Professionally experienced Junior Frontend Developer and Senior Graphics Designer with a track record of successful project deliveries, bid process / legacy project support as well as freelance work. Outgoing team player with an eye for constant improvement, effective content production, automatisation and optimisation with an aim of elevating the company profile in the eyes of new and existing customers. My choice of becoming a Frontend developer is closely aligned with the desire to develop  engineer-like problem solving skills and be at the front seat of new, constantly evolving technologies that drive the web forward.
